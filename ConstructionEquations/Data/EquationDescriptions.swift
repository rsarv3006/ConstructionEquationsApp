let PythagoreanTheoremDescription = """
In construction, the Pythagorean theorem serves as a fundamental tool for ensuring accuracy and precision in various geometric calculations. Whether designing buildings, laying out foundations, or constructing frameworks, this theorem proves indispensable. By understanding the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right triangle, construction professionals can accurately determine distances, verify right angles, and ensure structural integrity. For instance, when measuring diagonals to ensure squares or rectangles are perfectly aligned, or when calculating the length of rafters for roofing, the Pythagorean theorem provides a reliable method for achieving precise results. Its application extends beyond basic geometry, aiding in complex tasks such as surveying land and creating intricate architectural designs, ultimately contributing to the safety and stability of construction projects.
"""

let CubicYardDescription = """
The cubic yard is a unit of volume that is commonly used in construction (in the US). It is defined as the volume of a cube with edges that are one yard in length. This unit of measurement is frequently used to quantify the amount of material required for various construction projects, such as concrete, soil, gravel, and other aggregates. By understanding the relationship between length, width, and height, construction professionals can accurately calculate the volume of materials needed for a project, ensuring that the appropriate amount is ordered and delivered. This knowledge is essential for minimizing waste, optimizing cost-efficiency, and maintaining the integrity of construction projects.
"""

let ArchDescription = """
The arch is a fundamental architectural element that has been used in construction for thousands of years. It is a curved structure that spans an opening and supports the weight of the material above it. Arches are used in a variety of construction projects, including bridges, aqueducts, and buildings, and they are known for their strength, stability, and aesthetic appeal. By understanding the principles of arch construction, construction professionals can design and build structures that are both functional and visually striking. The use of arches in construction has a rich history and continues to be a defining feature of architectural design, contributing to the beauty and durability of buildings and infrastructure around the world.
